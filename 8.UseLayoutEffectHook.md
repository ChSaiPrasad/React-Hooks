useLayoutEffect Hook
The useLayoutEffect hook is similar to the useEffect hook, but with a key difference in when it is executed 
Execution Timing: useLayoutEffect runs before the user interface (UI) is mounted and displayed on the screen This is in contrast to useEffect, which runs after the UI has been painted to the DOM  

Preventing Flickering: The timing of useLayoutEffect makes it useful for preventing flickering or blinking issues. If you need to make a change to a DOM element, such as changing its color, useLayoutEffect can apply that change before the element is even visible to the user. This ensures the correct final state is displayed without a brief flash of the initial state  

Syntax: The syntax for useLayoutEffect is similar to useEffect, taking a callback function and an optional dependency array [01:56:49].

The useLayoutEffect console message appears first in the console, confirming that it executes before the UI is rendered 
The useEffect console message appears after the UI elements have been fully rendered, demonstrating that it runs after the DOM is painted

This shows that even if useEffect is written before useLayoutEffect in the code, useLayoutEffect will always run first because of its execution timing in the React lifecycle 

Use Cases:

Measuring DOM elements
Animating elements
Fixing flickering or blinking issues
Making API calls (though useEffect is generally recommended for this)
