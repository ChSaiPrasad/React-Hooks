useCallback Hook
The useCallback hook is a React hook that caches a function's definition between re-renders. This prevents the creation of multiple instances of the same function and can improve application performance

It is similar to useMemo, but useMemo returns a memoized value, while useCallback returns a memoized function [01:05:05].

Example: useCallback to Prevent Unnecessary Rerenders
Initial Problem: An example is set up with an App component that contains a counter and a Header component. The Header component is wrapped with React.memo to prevent it from re-rendering unless its props change. A function is passed as a prop to the Header component

Referential Equality: When the counter's state in the App component is updated, it causes the App component to re-render. Since a new function instance is created on each render, the Header component receives a "new" prop, causing it to re-render as well . This is demonstrated by showing that a new function instance is not strictly equal to the previous instance, even if the code is identical.

Solution with useCallback: To solve this, the function passed to the Header component is wrapped with useCallback .

useCallback takes two arguments: a callback function and a dependency array 

By using an empty dependency array [], useCallback caches the function and ensures that the Header component receives the same function instance on subsequent renders, thus preventing it from re-rendering unnecessarily

Demonstrating Dependency Changes: what happens when a dependency, such as the count state, is added to the useCallback hook's dependency array. Now, every time the count changes, a new function instance is created and passed to the Header component, causing it to re-render  This demonstrates that useCallback only creates a new function instance when a value in its dependency array changes.
