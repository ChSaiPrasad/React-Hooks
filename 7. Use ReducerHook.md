useReducer Hook
The useReducer hook is similar to useState but is used for more complex state logic. It provides a state variable and a dispatch function instead of a state and a setter function
Arguments:
A reducer function that specifies how the state is updated 
An initial state

Returns:
The current state.
A dispatch method used to trigger state updates

Example: Creating a Counter
 creating a counter that can be increased or decreased.

Initial Setup: An initial state object with a count of zero is declared. The useReducer hook is initialized with a reducer function and the initial state, returning the current state and a dispatch function 

Reducer Function: A reducer function is defined that accepts the current state and an action. It uses a switch statement to determine how to update the state based on the action type 

case 'increase': Returns a new state object where the count is increased by one 

case 'decrease': Returns a new state object where the count is decreased by one 

Dispatching Actions: The dispatch function is called with an object containing a type property (e.g., { type: 'increase' }) from the button onClick event handlers. This triggers the reducer to update the state 
Handling User Input: The example is extended to include an input field. An 'input' action type is added to the reducer, which updates the state with the value from the input field's payload
```

function App() {
  const initialState = {count: 0}

  const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increase': {
          return { count: state.count + 1 }
        }
      case 'decrease': {
          return { count: state.count - 1 }
        }
      default: {
          return state
      }
    }
  }

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

  return (
 <>
      <p>state.count</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({
        type: 'increase'
      })}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({
        type: 'decrease'
      })}>Decrease</button>
   </> 
  )
}
  
Example 2
 import {useReducer} from 'react';

function App() {
  const initialState = {count: 0 };

  const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increase': {
        return {
          count: state.count + 1
        };
      }
      case 'decrease': {
        return {
          count: state.count - 1
        };
      }
      case 'input': {
        return {
          count: action.payload
        };
      }
      default: {
        return state;
      }
    }
  };

  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return ( <    >
    <h1 > {state.count} < /h1>
     <button onClick = {() => dispatch({type: 'increase'})} > Increase < /button> 
     <button onClick = {() => dispatch({type: 'decrease'})} > Decrease < /button>
     <br / >
    <input value = {state.count}  onChange = {(e) => dispatch({type: 'input',payload: Number(e.target.value)}) }   type = "number" / > 
     </>
  );
}
</pre>
