 useEffect allows you to perform side effects in your components, such as fetching data, directly updating the DOM, or setting up timers 

Syntax: useEffect takes two arguments: a callback function and an optional dependency array 

Ways to use useEffect:

Without a dependency array: The effect runs after every render of the component

With an empty array []: The effect runs only once when the component is first loaded

With variables in the array [variable]: The effect runs when the component is first loaded and again whenever any of the variables in the dependency array change [01:04:18].



useEffect Hook
The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Examples of side effects include fetching data from an API, directly updating the DOM, and timers such as setTimeout or setInterval

The hook has two main parts: a callback function and an optional dependency array 

Ways to Use useEffect
The useEffect hook can be used in three different ways, which are explained through a counter example that updates a message indicating how many times the component has been rendered:

Without any dependencies:
In this method, the useEffect hook will execute its callback function whenever any state in the component changes .

 an example where a timer is set to increase a counter value by one every two seconds  . Because the counter value is a state variable, every time it changes, the component re-renders, causing the useEffect hook to run again and restart the timer. This results in the counter increasing continuously, creating an infinite loop .

With an empty dependency array ([]):
When an empty array is provided, the useEffect hook will execute its callback function only once when the component is first loaded .
Using the same counter example, the timer will run just one time, causing the counter to increase from 0 to 1, and then stop .

With a dependency array containing variables:
In this approach, the useEffect hook executes the callback function when the component loads and whenever any of the variables listed in the dependency array change .

For the counter example, if the count state variable is added to the dependency array, the hook will run every time the count changes  This causes the timer to run repeatedly, leading to the counter increasing continuously by one every two seconds, similar to the first example without dependencies  

You can include multiple state variables in the dependency array. If any of them change, the hook will be re-executed
