useRef Hook
The useRef hook is a React hook that allows you to create mutable variables that do not cause the component to re-render when their values change. It is also used to access 
and modify DOM elements.

Key Concepts:
Non-rendering mutation: Unlike useState, changing a useRef variable does not trigger a component re-render. This is useful for storing values that need to persist across 
renders but don't need to update the UI.
Accessing DOM elements: It can be used to get a direct reference to a DOM element, allowing for manipulation such as changing styles or focusing an input field

Example 1: Creating a Render Counter
A counter is created using useRef with an initial value of 0.
An useEffect hook without any dependencies is used to increment the counter every time the component renders.
The value of the useRef variable is accessed via its .current property (count.current).
This approach prevents an infinite loop that would occur if useState were used for the same purpose because useRef does not cause re-renders

Example 2: Accessing a DOM Element
A useRef variable is created, for example, inputElement
This ref is then attached to a DOM element, such as an <input> tag, using the ref attribute (<input ref={inputElement} />) 
A button with an onClick event is set up to demonstrate accessing and modifying the DOM element 
When the button is clicked, a function logs the input element to the console by accessing inputElement.current 
It also changes the element's background color by setting a style property on inputElement.current
