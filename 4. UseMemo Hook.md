useMemo Hook
The useMemo hook is a React hook that returns a memoized value, which is a technique for caching a value so that it doesn't need to be re-calculated on every render This can significantly improve an application's performance, especially for expensive calculations.

The hook only re-runs the calculation when one of its dependencies is updated

comparison between useMemo and the useCallback hook:
useMemo returns a memoized value.
useCallback returns a memoized function.

Example: Calculating the Cube of a Number
demonstrates the problem that useMemo solves by creating a React component with two state variables and a function to calculate the cube of a number

State Variables:
number: Stores the value from an input field, initialized to 0 
counter: Stores a count that can be increased by clicking a button, initialized to 0

CubeNum Function:
A function CubeNum is defined to calculate the cube of a number using Math.pow(num, 3)
A console.log message is added inside this function to show when it is executed ("calculation done")

UI Elements:
An input field to change the number state
A button (Counter ++) to update the counter state
The cube of the number and the current counter value are displayed on the page

The Problem Without useMemo
When the counter button is clicked, it updates the counter state, which causes the component to re-render. During this re-render, the CubeNum function is re-executed, even though the number state (its input) hasn't changed This unnecessary recalculation is logged to the console, showing the “calculation done” message every time the counter increases

Solution with useMemo
To solve this, the useMemo hook is used to wrap the CubeNum function call
First, useMemo is imported from the React library
The CubeNum(number) call is placed inside useMemo, which takes a callback function and a dependency array

The number state variable is added to the dependency array [number]

With this implementation, the CubeNum function will only be executed when the number dependency changes. Clicking the Counter ++ button will no longer trigger the “calculation done” message in the console , demonstrating that the expensive calculation is now being cached. When the number is updated in the input field, the useMemo hook detects the change in the number dependency and re-executes the function, logging the message as expected
