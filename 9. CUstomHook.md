Custom Hooks in React

Why Use Custom Hooks?
Reusability: If you have a block of logic that needs to be used in multiple components, you can extract it into a custom hook instead of duplicating the code

Example Scenario: involving managing data in a browser's local storage  This includes setting up state variables, using useEffect to save data to local storage whenever a value changes, and retrieving data from local storage on page load  This logic is a good candidate for a custom hook because it can be used for different pieces of data (e.g., name, user ID) in various components.

Creating a Custom Hook
Naming Convention: A custom hook's name must start with the word use (e.g., useState, useEffect, useLocalstorage) 

Implementation Steps 
Create a file for the hook (e.g., useLocalstorage.jsx) inside a dedicated folder like hooks
Extract the logic from the component into the new hook file. This includes the useState and useEffect logic [02:09:27].

Define parameters for the hook, such as a key for the local storage item and an initialValue [02:09:47].

Adapt the logic to use these parameters. The hook will now use the provided key to get/set data from local storage and the initial value to set the state [02:10:11].

Return the state variable and its setter function from the custom hook, just like useState does [02:11:15]. This allows components to use the hook and access its functionality.

Using a Custom Hook
The custom hook is used in a component just like any other built-in hook [02:12:21].

You can declare state variables by calling the custom hook and providing the required arguments, such as a key and an initial value [02:12:47].

The hook returns an array containing the state value and a setter function, which can then be used in the component's JSX to display and update the data [02:13:15].

The video demonstrates how to use the same useLocalstorage hook for a user's name and a user's ID, showing how a single hook can handle different pieces of data with the same underlying logic [02:15:02]. This avoids code repetition and makes the application more maintainable.
