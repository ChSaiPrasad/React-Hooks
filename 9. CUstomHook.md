Custom Hooks in React

Why Use Custom Hooks?
Reusability: If you have a block of logic that needs to be used in multiple components, you can extract it into a custom hook instead of duplicating the code

Example Scenario: involving managing data in a browser's local storage  This includes setting up state variables, using useEffect to save data to local storage whenever a value changes, and retrieving data from local storage on page load  This logic is a good candidate for a custom hook because it can be used for different pieces of data (e.g., name, user ID) in various components.

Creating a Custom Hook
Naming Convention: A custom hook's name must start with the word use (e.g., useState, useEffect, useLocalstorage) 

Implementation Steps 
Create a file for the hook (e.g., useLocalstorage.jsx) inside a dedicated folder like hooks
Extract the logic from the component into the new hook file. This includes the useState and useEffect logic 

Define parameters for the hook, such as a key for the local storage item and an initialValue
Adapt the logic to use these parameters. The hook will now use the provided key to get/set data from local storage and the initial value to set the state 
Return the state variable and its setter function from the custom hook, just like useState does  This allows components to use the hook and access its functionality.

Using a Custom Hook
The custom hook is used in a component just like any other built-in hook 
You can declare state variables by calling the custom hook and providing the required arguments, such as a key and an initial value 
The hook returns an array containing the state value and a setter function, which can then be used in the component's JSX to display and update the data 
The video demonstrates how to use the same useLocalstorage hook for a user's name and a user's ID, showing how a single hook can handle different pieces of data with the same underlying logic This avoids code repetition and makes the application more maintainable.
