The useContext hook allows you to access data from any component without having to pass props down manually at every level of the component tree. This is particularly useful for managing global data within a React application. The process of using this hook is broken down into three steps:

Step 1: Creating the Context
To begin, you create a new file, for example appContext.jsx, and import createContext from React
You then create a context using createContext and store it in a variable, such as appContext
A provider function is created, named Context provider, which will hold the global data, like a phone number or a name [01:24:05]. This provider function is what allows other components to access the data.

Step 2: Providing the Context
The Context provider is used to wrap the components that need access to the global data. In the example, the App component is wrapped with Context provider in the main.jsx file, making the data available to all components nested inside App

Step 3: Consuming the Context
To use the data in a component, you must first import the useContext hook and the context file (e.g., appContext.jsx) 
A variable is declared to hold the data, and the useContext hook is called with the context file as an argument. The data can then be used directly within the component This method eliminates the need to pass data through props at every level of the component tree, avoiding what is known as "prop drilling."
